The results of this analysis are intended to be used by entrepreneurs interested in opening a restaurant of an any given type in one of the 21 _localidades_ (boroughs) of the Colombia's capital city.\n\nIn order to deliver valuable information to our target audience, we will identify those city zones where the restaurant and food service industry are already located and what type of restaurants or food business are running. Also, we will identify locations that have not plenty of restaurants already. This way we will provide information so the most promising neighborhoods and the best possible location can be chosen by the entrepreneur. "
